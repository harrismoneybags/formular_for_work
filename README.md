Hello all; 

Would first like to start by saying not completly 'au fait' with git hub or python and I'm currently learnig electrical calculations for a course, 
so here I am effectively killing three birds with one stone.

The end goal is to have all of these calculations work in a web app or moblie app just need to learn user interface.
